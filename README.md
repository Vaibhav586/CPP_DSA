# LeetCode DSA Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from LeetCode, implemented in C++. The goal of this repository is to document my DSA learning journey and provide a reference for others studying algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by problem categories:

```
├── Arrays
├── Strings
├── Linked Lists
├── Trees
├── Graphs
├── Dynamic Programming
├── Greedy Algorithms
├── Sorting and Searching
├── Recursion and Backtracking
├── Math
└── Miscellaneous
```

Each solution file includes:
- Problem description and link to the original LeetCode question
- My C++ solution
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Explanation of the approach used

## How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to the relevant category folder
2. Find the problem by its LeetCode number or name
3. Review the solution and explanation
